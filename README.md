# üõ°Ô∏è AUTENTICA

AUTENTICA is a secure document verification system that ensures authenticity and integrity of digital files. It allows authorities (admins) to upload, generate, and verify documents using cryptographic hashing, digital signatures, and blockchain storage. A built-in Gemini AI chatbot assists both admins and users throughout the process.

## üöÄ Overview

AUTENTICA provides a seamless and tamper-proof document verification process by combining blockchain, cryptography, and artificial intelligence.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Components

### 1. Backend (Verify-Main ‚Äì Go)
- Allows admin to upload files and input details.
- Generates document templates.
- Computes SHA-256 hash of the document.
- Uses RSA for digital signatures (private & public key encryption).
- Stores file hash in IPFS and saves the CID (Content Identifier) on the blockchain.
- Verifies digital signatures using RSA.
- Provides an email service to send documents.

### 2. Frontend (React)
- User-friendly interface for both admins and users.
- Admin panel for file upload, document generation, and sending emails.
- User panel for verifying digital signatures.
- Integrated chatbot for assistance.

### 3. Python Script
- Handles email automation and cryptographic operations.
- Interacts with IPFS for storing and verifying document hashes.

### 4. Chatbot (Gemini AI)
- Helps admins manage files and handle verification queries.
- Assists users in verifying digital signatures and checking document authenticity.

## üîÑ How It Works

### Admin Actions
1. Uploads file or adds details.  
2. Generates document and computes SHA-256 hash.  
3. Signs the hash using RSA private key.  
4. Stores document hash in IPFS and saves CID on the blockchain.  
5. Sends the document via email.

### User Actions
1. Receives the document.  
2. Verifies the digital signature using the public key.  
3. Compares stored hash from blockchain.  
4. Uses chatbot for guidance if needed.
